# AgglomDetector

Simple project that aims to know if there is an agglomeration of people at a specific point using IoT technologies. To achieve this objective we observe how many Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks there are near the microcontroller.


The code will be implemented on a [Lopy4](https://pycom.io/product/lopy4/) from the manufacturer [Pycom](https://pycom.io).
